## Background and Rational

Many zoos must have a management system because it is very important as it affects the management and care of the zoo effectively. For example, data management is one of the crucial aspects that the system can help with by processing information about all animals. In the zoo, planning and resource management are essential. The health and development of animals are also areas where the system can assist in management. With the right system, we can monitor animal health, detect illnesses, and plan appropriate health care. Having a system can help increase efficiency in controlling safety in a zoo, including controlling the entry and exit of animals and visitors, as well as responding to potential threats.

The Zootopia management system was conceptualized when I came across a picture of a raccoon on social media while thinking about the project. This image prompted me to envision running a system in a zoo, sparking my interest in creating a system that could efficiently manage and care for a zoo.
